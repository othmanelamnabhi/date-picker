# Javascript Simplified: Date Picker

On this project from the [Javascript Simplified](https://javascriptsimplified.com) course, I made a fully funcional date picker.

The challenge was to manipulate the Date object to
* find when the month starts and locate the start of week of that month
* do the same for when the month ends
* render all dates between start and end of the month
* render them into a grid forming thus the date picker
* highlight the selected date and persist the selected date even when browsing to other months

This was a fun project, got to play with date-fns, super helpful package.

## Installation


* Clone the repo, `cd` into the directory and run `npm install` in the terminal then once install is done run `npm start`.
